Code Smells and Areas for Improvement:

1. Dependency Management: Each layer creates its own dependencies (controllers create services, services create repositories) instead of using dependency injection.

2. Manual JSON Parsing: The repository manually parses JSON without using libraries, which is error-prone and verbose.

3. Business Logic in Controllers: The WiseSayingController contains pagination and search logic that should be in the service layer.

4. Error Handling: File operations lack proper error handling, with some exceptions being silently caught and others propagating as RuntimeExceptions.

5. Test Issues: Several tests are failing, indicating problems with the application logic, particularly in registration, deletion, and pagination.

6. Code Duplication: WiseSayingService is instantiated multiple times (in both controllers), leading to potential state inconsistencies.

7. Lack of Abstraction: Direct file I/O operations in the repository without abstraction makes it difficult to change the persistence mechanism.

8. Formatting Issues: The output format doesn't match what the tests expect, causing test failures.
